# Checker
Script that checks the given "thing"(let it be IP, Hash, Domain, etc) against the OSINT tools that i use the most, giving a quick glance at all the info relevant to it.

At the moment it's a incomplete version of the whole idea. The file tor_list its necesary to check if the IP its present in the list "https://www.dan.me.uk/torlist/", downloaded cuz of restrictions in this web.

<strong> Completed </strong>
